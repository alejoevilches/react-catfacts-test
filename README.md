# Catfacts app - Technical test

This repository cointains a technical test for a Frontend Trainee position. It's a app that shows random cat facts and random cat images
using 2 different APIs: Cataas and Cat Fact.



## Tech Stack

This project was made using React + Vite. I installed manually all the React plugins so it's not made using boilerplates. The styles are made using pure CSS and
the testing was implemented using Playwright.
